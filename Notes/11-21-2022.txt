some stuff about the user model: (stuff the StudySession model relies on)
 - needs to validate the userName of each created new user (username should be a unique identifier) 
 - needs a class method called loadUser that takes in a string of the username and returns a userObject

other notes:
 - the study session name will be a unique identifier, the construstor will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the name is invalid.
 - there will be an ObservableList in the StudySession class that has all the locations in it as Strings, we can use that to list all the locations.
 - - it can be referenced at "StudySessions.locations"
